 *   2. Application imports. Files imported after ZoneJS that should be loaded
 * before your main file.
 *
 * The current setup is for so-called "evergreen" browsers; the last versions of

 * Chrome >= 55 (including Opera), Edge >= 13 on the desktop, and iOS 10 and
 * Chrome on mobile.

 * user can disable parts of macroTask/DomEvents patch by setting following
 * flags because those flags need to be set before `zone.js` being loaded, and
 * webpack will put import in the top of bundle, so user need to create a
 * separate file in this directory (for example: zone-flags.ts), and put the
 * following flags into that file, and then add the following code before
 * importing zone.js. import './zone-flags.ts';
 *
 * The flags allowed in zone-flags.ts are listed here.
 *
 * The following flags will work for all browsers.
 *
 * (window as any).__Zone_disable_requestAnimationFrame = true; // disable patch
 * requestAnimationFrame (window as any).__Zone_disable_on_property = true; //
 * disable patch onProperty such as onclick (window as
 * any).__zone_symbol__UNPATCHED_EVENTS = ['scroll', 'mousemove']; // disable
 * patch specified eventNames
 *
 *  in IE/Edge developer tools, the addEventListener will also be wrapped by
 * zone.js with the following flag, it will bypass `zone.js` patch for IE/Edge
